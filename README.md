## Tastemate-food-management-system_
✳️ Project Statement: 

👉 Managing food choices can be challenging for students and working professionals living away from home. To solve this, I developed TasteMate, a web-based food management platform that allows nearby canteens and messes to register, update daily menus, and let students explore meal options conveniently.

✳️ Implementation: 

👉 Built a full-stack web application using Django. 

👉 Designed separate dashboards for canteens (to update breakfast, lunch, and dinner menus) and students (to view menus and place requests). 

👉 Integrated authentication for secure logins and role-based access. 

👉 Created a responsive user interface with Bootstrap and JavaScript to improve accessibility across devices.

✳️ Tech Stack: 

👉 Programming Language: Python .

👉 Frameworks: Django, Django REST Framework .

👉 Frontend: HTML, CSS,Jinja templates,JavaScript,Bootstrap.

👉 Database: SQLite / PostgreSQL. 

👉 Concepts: CRUD Operations, REST APIs, Authentication & Authorization, Real-time Notifications

✳️ Outcome: Delivered a functional management system that simplifies daily menu updates for canteens and improves decision-making for students. Enhanced engagement through real-time notifications and responsive UI, showcasing both backend system design and frontend development capabilities.
